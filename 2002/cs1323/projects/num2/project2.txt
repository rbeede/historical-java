Februaru 4, 2000

Due:   February 11th at the beginning of Lab

1.0	Objectives

1. To be able to write simple arithmetic expressions to accomplish a specific task.
2. To be able to use these classes in a specified manner:
	 MainWindow, Math, InputBox, and OutputBox 
3. To be able to debug a program with syntax errors.
4. To be able to debug a program with logic errors.

2.0	Class <Give your class a name and place that name here>

Use an editor and write Java code according to the instructions in Exercise #20 in Chapter 3 
(page 137) from your textbook. Use the template given in Project 1 to help get you started.  
Keep in mind that you will have to define the body of main in such a way to customize it to 
this Project.  You should use a method from the Math class in the java.lang package in order to 
find d2 (see the discussion of the Math class on page 100 in your textbook).    Also, see the 
LoanCalculator program (part of the "Exercises for Fixing and Compilation Errors" hand out) 
for clues to writing the code for this project.  You must use the MainWindow, Math, InputBox,
and OutputBox classes to complete this project.

Do not forget to include your comment header.
