Save your code in a file named TestOutputBox.java and compile it. Don't be surprised if your program doesn't compile the first time.  Compilers are very fussy about programs - the program must have all of the right characters in the right places to compile.  Look very carefully for typographical errors before you compile the program. Java is case sensitive, so you must pay attention to the use of capitalization.  The compiler will try to help you locate errors, but it isn't always right.  If you get a string of errors, correct the first error, then recompile.  The rest may just go away.  If they don't, of course, you have to fix them.

Before letting the compiler catch the errors, review the code and correct them.

Create a separate folder for all your projects files. Don't use Microsoft Word as your program editor. Use an editor such as Edit. 

The TAs will provide you with instructions in the lab as to how you should submit this project assignment.
