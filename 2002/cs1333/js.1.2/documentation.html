<h1 align=center>The structure Package Documentation</h1>

From here you can view the entire documentation set for the structure
package.  From the beginning, documentation of the structure package
was considered important.  Here, we are able to see the hierarchy of
classes within the package, some of which shadow similar structures
available through Java's own libraries.
<p>
For each public method of each class we have provided pre- and
post-conditions associated with the method.  In short, the
precondition suggests what must be true before the method is to be
called, and the postcondition indicates what will happen if the
precondition is met and the method is called.  These comments are part
of every method of every class, appear in the source files, and are
part of the text.
<p>
In addition, we have added a separate set of javadoc comments for each
method of every class. These comments describe every parameter, and
the return values, if applicable.  We also include the pre- and
postconditions.  These comments are elided from the distributed source
code because they are so bulky they make it difficult for students to
read the code, and they do not appear within the text.
