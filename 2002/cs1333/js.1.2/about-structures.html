<h1 align=center>About the <tt>structure</tt> Package</h1>

<font size=+1>
I developed the Java structure package two years ago in an attempt to
provide a stable foundation for studying data structures in CS2.  In
the process of writing the software, the book <i>Java Structures</i>
was written.  Today, the result is software class tested over four
semesters at a number of institutions.  In addition, a number of
students have used the package for supporting development of
applications and applets for their own use.
<p>
The package contains approximately 80 fully and consistently developed
classes supporting the full range of data structures studied in a
modern CS2 course.  The package makes reasonable use of inheritance
and interface design.  None of the structures have been declared
final, making it possible for students and faculty to extend on the
stable platform of structures.   Since none of the structures makes
significant use of rapidly moving packages at Sun (including the AWT),
it is unlikely that significant changes in the design of the Java
environment will have lasting impact on the design of the structures
package itself.  In particular, many of the design decisions made in
the structures package have been paralleled in the Java environment.
<p>
The code is annotated with pre- and post-conditions that help the user
understand the conditions required before the method may be expected
to work, and the conditions that are likely to be achieved when the
method is executed.  Using Sun's javadoc, the code is fully
documented, but the (ugly and distracting) javadoc commentary has been
removed from sources to focus attention on the (same) comments
incorporated into each method.  All the software, including updates
can be found on the web (see <br>

Most importantly, my wish is that the structures package be a
contribution to the educational community.  As a result, while
McGraw-Hill holds a copyright on the software, they have agreed free
distribution of the software.  Generally, you make make whatever
educational use of the software you wish, as long as you don't
directly make any money (see our <a href="distribution-policy.html">agreement</a>).
<p>
I hope you enjoy this package.  I encourage, of course, your comments
on the package and details of how you have found it useful (or
not...).

Enjoy!<br>
