<h1>About <em>Java Structures</em></h1>
</center>

<font size=+1>The First Edition <em>Java Structures: Data Structures in Java for the Principled
Programmer</em> is now available from McGraw-Hill (ISBN 007-289-1793)
for use in CS2 courses.
Now, after several years of class testing,
it is compatible with environments
that support the Java Development Toolkit (JDK) 1.2 or 1.1.

Where I'm coming from:
<blockquote>
``When I first 
started working with computers, they were resources used by a 
privileged (or persistent) few.  They were physically 
large, and logically small.  They were cast from iron.  The challenge 
was to make these behemoths solve complex problems quickly.
<p>
``Today, computers are everywhere.  They are in the office and at home.  
They speak to us on telephones, they zap our food in the microwave.  
They make starting cars in New England a possibility.  Everyone's using them.
What has aided their introduction into society is their diminished 
size and cost, and increased capability.  The challenge
is to make these behemoths solve complex problems quickly.
<p>
``Thus, while the computer and its applications have changed over time,
the challenge remains the same: <em>How can we get the best
performance out of the current technology?</em>  The design and analysis
of data structures lays the fundamental groundwork for a scientific
understanding of what computers can do efficiently.  The motivations
for data structure design work accomplished three decades ago in
assembly language at the keypunch are just as familiar to us today as
we practice our craft in modern languages on computers on our laps.
The focus of this material is the identification and development of
relatively <em>abstract</em> principles for
structuring data in ways that make programs efficient in terms of
their consumption of resources, <em>as well as efficient in terms of
`programmability.'</em>

``In the past, my students have encountered this material in Pascal,
Modula-2, and, most recently,
C++. None of these languages
has been ideal, but each has been met with increasing expectation.
This text uses The Java Programming Language - `Java' - to
structure data.
Java is a new and exciting language that has received considerable
public attention.  At the time of this writing, for example, Java is
one of the few tools that can effectively use the Internet as a
computing resource.  That particular aspect of Java is not touched
on greatly in this text.  Still, Internet-driven applications in
Java will need supporting data structures. This book attempts to
provide a fresh and focused approach to the design and implementation
of classic structures in a manner that meshes well with existing
Java packages.  It is hoped that learning this material in Java
will improve the way working programmers craft programs, and the way
future designers craft languages.''
