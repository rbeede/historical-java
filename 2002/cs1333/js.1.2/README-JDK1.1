This distribution of the structure package is suitable for use
with JDK 1.2.  If your environment makes use of JDK 1.1, you should
download the 1.1 version of the structure package, or perform the
following changes:

1. Create a file, Comparable.java, in the source directory.  It should
contain the following interface:

  public interface Comparable
  {
      public int compareTo(Object item);
      // pre: item is non-null
      // post: returns value < 0 if this<item; 0 if =; > 0 if this > item
  }

(A copy of this code can be found in the examples directory, under
Comparable1.2.java.  If you use this, make sure you change the name of
the file.)

2.  Compile Comparable.java.  This should create a class file,
Comparable.class.   This should be moved to the structure directory.

3.  If you plan to use the structure.zip file as a library, make sure
you add the class file to the zip.  On unix, this involves the zip
utility.  In other environments, you may have to make changes to a
project file.


The result of these changes is source and libraries that are suitable
for use with JDK 1.1.

The 1.1 version of the structure pacakge is also available from
   http://www.cs.williams.edu/~bailey/JavaStructures/js.1.1

Enjoy!
