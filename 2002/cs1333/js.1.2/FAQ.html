Here are answers to some common questions about the structures
package.

<hr>
<b>
What is the structure package all about?
</b>
<p>
I wrote the structure package because core Java has poor support for
the study of object-oriented data structures.  This state is
improving but, still, there are many inconsistencies and holes within
the Java language packages available from Sun that make teaching a
course on data structures (CS2) difficult.  These issues are,
somewhat, covered in the text.
<p>
Here, however, are some highlights:
<ul>
<li> This is one package.  Data structures are not distributed between
a large number of packages that are difficult to find.
<li> The structures are developed by one designer.  This provides a
consistency of approach not often found in commercial products.
<li> It is tested and stable code.  This package has been course
tested for two years.
</ul>
<hr>
<b> Who may use the structures package?</b>
<p>
The structures package is freely available for non-commercial use from
<a href="http://www.mhhe.com/javastructures">McGraw-Hill</a>.  You need not buy the text to use it, but you may not
make money from its use.
<hr>
<b> Under what environments may this code be used?</b>
<p>
The structures package available currently from <a
href="http://www.mhhe.com/javastructures">McGraw-Hill</a> works with
any environment that is Java JDK 1.1 compliant.  
Software that works specifically with JDK 1.2 is also available.
As Sun improves its support for data structures, the structures
package is made to be as consistent as possible with the existing JDK.
<hr>
<b> You provide javadoc-based documentation, but there is no javadoc
documentation in the source code.  Why? </b>
<p>
The on-line documentation is generated from a master copy of the
structure package that has these comments.  For release, these
comments are removed, providing a more readable source for programmers
to peruse.  Javadoc comments are great reading for the javadoc
utility; they're not so great for humans.
<p>
<i>The javadoc comments are a subset of the comments found in the
source.</i>
<p>
If you believe you absolutely need the javadoc comments, contact the
author at <a href="mailto:bailey@cs.williams.edu"><address>bailey@cs.williams.edu</address></a>.
<hr>
<b>You re-implement some data structures already implemented by Sun.
Why?</b>
<p>
To ensure there are no copyright infringements I provide (often simpler)
non-commercial implementations of some classes.  Sometime of these
implementations may not be as efficient as the commercial classes, but
the details of the implementation are easier to grasp.  Of course, if
necessary, the code can be modified to make use of those
implementations found in Java's native classes.
<hr>
<b>What do you mean by "for the principled programmer"?</b>
<p>
Learning how to program well is a difficult task.  One that can,
arguably, take many years of practice beyond coursework.  One of the
reasons for this is that there are a number of "tricks of the trade"
or "heuristics" that guide experienced programmers, that are not often
conveyed (or conveyed well) by existing texts.  In the Java Structures
text, I present a number of "principles" (rules-of-thumb, really) that
guide the data structure design process.
<hr>
<b>Why are private fields of the structures not declared private?</b>
<p>
The reasoning for this is long and drawn out (and discussed more fully
in the text), but basically, there is no disadvantage to declaring
these fields protected.  The particular distinctions between private,
protected, public, and default protects are rather technical and their
motivation is somewhat difficult to understand.
<hr>
<b>What differences are there between the JDK 1.1 and the JDK 1.2
versions of the software?</b>
<p>
When JDK 1.2 was announced, Sun added a number of important new
features to their packages - including -
- <tt>java.lang.Comparable</tt>.  Java Structures defines a very
similar interface, called <tt>structure.Comparable</tt>.  Because of a
naming conflict introduced by the default importing of
<tt>java.lang</tt>, I made the decision to adopt Sun's definition of
<tt>Comparable</tt>.  This necessitates recasting many of the classes
of the <tt>structure</tt> package, requiring a re-release.  I do not
expect conflicts in the future, but Sun may further encroach on the
namespace of data structures distributed under the <tt>structure</tt> package.
<hr>
<b>Do you teach this course using applets or applications?</b>
<p>
When I teach this course, I teach it using applications.  Many of my
colleagues use applets.  Either approach is satisfactory, as long as
Java, itself, does not get in the way of understanding data
structures.
<p>
Unfortunately, there are many disadvantages to using applets in this
course - the primary problem being security.  Security makes it 
difficult (and sometimes impossible) to perform input from a keyboard,
or to read data from a file.  Both of these are often useful in a data
structures course.
<p>
<i>Here is something to think about.</i>  As tax-paying citizens, we
keep track of tax freedom day - the first day of the year that we are
earn money above and beyond the money we earn to pay our taxes.
(Currently, that day appears about 28% of the way through the calendar
year...ironically, in mid-April.) In a typical programming course, what is
<b>Programmer Freedom Day</b> - the day that a programmer can first be
expected to write an entire program without the help of the
instructor.
<p>
Unfortunately, Programmer Freedom Day has been moving later and later
in the semester.  To use applets, Programmer Freedom Day is
considerably later than if you use applications.
