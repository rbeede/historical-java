Objective #1:  Develop a benchmarking class to time certain operations
	I achieved this one.  See Benchmark.java

Objective #2:  Use random and pre-sorted data to generate BST's and Splay Trees
	I achieved this one.  See Engine.java and Benchmark.ajva

Objective #3:  Time searches on BST's and Splay Trees to determine performance
	I achieved this one.  Run TreeTest program

Objective #4:  Write a 2-3 page paper analyzing the results of the benchmark
   which:
 4.1)  Describe the methods used to generate results
 4.2)  Details the complete results of the tests
 4.3)  Explains why the results turned out how they did

	I achieved all these.  See "Project Results.doc"
	I also have a copy of test data in TestData.txt
