Objective #1:  Implement Insertion Sort Recursively on a Vector of Objects
	I partially met this requirement.  I did succuessfully sort the Vector
  	but was unable to do this recursively due to time running out

Objective #2:  Implement a Recursive Binary Search
	I partially met this requirement.  I partially returned searches
	correctly, however only the 1st entry would return the defintion

	I did not have time to make this recursive


Objective #3:  Use Real-Time User I/O
	I did manage to open up the dict file for reading, but had to
	comment out the code to do so since I couldn't use that data
	I also managed to get input from the user on the command line


Objective #4:  (changed) Use an Environmental Variable to Read in a Filename
               Get the username from the OS and use it to read in a filename

		I successed in doing this.  I makeup the filename and all
		in my code


Objective #5:  Implement a Dynamic Data Structure to Store a Dictionary
		I failed to achive this objective.  I could not get the
	data to parse after I had read it in.  I was able to store
	some static sample data into my data structure.  I could not
	get Stream or String Tokenizer to parse the data as I read it in
