Objective #1:  Implement a program to handle patients in an emergency room
	I partially achived this directive.  My program can load in the
the information about that patients, but cannot process them


Objective #2:  Use Queues, Stacks, and Lists to store patient and doctor data
	I achived this objective.  I have ADT that store databases and I have
ADT that store queries.  I used queues, stacks, and lists to do this.


Objective #3:  Implement recursive methods to display the contents of Stacks and Queues
	I did not fully achive this objective.  I used simple for loops to
gather the contents of my stacks and queues.

Objective #4:  Use Java Date and Random classes to generate patient data
	I did not meet this objective.  I never implemented that processing of
patients.
