Objective #1:  Use file I/O and command line arguments in Java
	I met this objective by passing filenames to my program

Objective #2:  Use a Vector to store and retrieve <keyword, color> pairs
	I met this objective by reading in the colors.txt file and parsing it

Objective #3:  Use the StreamTokenizer class to identify keywords, comments,
  and, quoted strings in Java code from the description in the standard
  Java documentation

	I met this objective by writing a Parser class that utilizes the
StreamTokenzier class
